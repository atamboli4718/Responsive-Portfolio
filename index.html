        <p class="aboutmecontent">Hello and welcome to my webpage! Here is a snapshot of me. My name is Alicia Tamboli 
            and I am a student in the UNCC Coding Bootcamp. I am also a mother to a 6 year old daughter, a wife to a 
            wonderful man, and an employee at a CLT area start up called Payzer. At the moment my free time is spent 
            working Bootcamp exercies! But when I am not doing that I enjoy running, hiking and spending time with 
            my family. I am not a native to Charlotte, but do love this part of the country! I hope to one day own a
            house by the beach to have a place to get away. The exact location for the beach house is tbd, Isle of Palms
            maybe!</p>
        <br>
        <p class="aboutmecontent"> I currently work on the Product team doing Quality Assurance at Payzer but I also have experience in Sales, 
            Client Support and team Management, and operations. When I am able, I will be writing automation 
            scripts to alleviate the need to manually test our 3 web sites and 2 applications. I am very excited to be 
            part of this program and would one day like to create web applications. I am excited my current company has 
            a place for me to start coding by writing web applications. This will allow me to get some great experience
            upon graduation. </p>
